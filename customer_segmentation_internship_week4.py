<h2 align="left"><font color=#ff6200>Problem:</font></h2>


In this project, we delve deep into the thriving sector of __online retail__ by analyzing a __transactional dataset__ from a UK-based retailer, available at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail). This dataset documents all transactions between 2010 and 2011. Our primary objective is to amplify the efficiency of marketing strategies and boost sales through __customer segmentation__. We aim to transform the transactional data into a customer-centric dataset by creating new features that will facilitate the segmentation of customers into distinct groups using the __K-means clustering__ algorithm. This segmentation will allow us to understand the distinct __profiles__ and preferences of different customer groups. Building upon this, we intend to develop a __recommendation system__ that will suggest top-selling products to customers within each segment who haven't purchased those items yet, ultimately enhancing marketing efficacy and fostering increased sales.

First we will perform a preliminary analysis to understand the structure and types of data columns:

<h3 align="left"><font color=#ff6200>Inferences:</font></h3>
    
The dataset consists of 541,909 entries and 8 columns. Here is a brief overview of each column:

- __`InvoiceNo`__: This is an object data type column that contains the invoice number for each transaction. Each invoice number can represent multiple items purchased in a single transaction.
   
    
- __`StockCode`__: An object data type column representing the product code for each item.

    
- __`Description`__: This column, also an object data type, contains descriptions of the products. It has some missing values, with 540,455 non-null entries out of 541,909.

    
- __`Quantity`__: This is an integer column indicating the quantity of products purchased in each transaction.
   

- __`InvoiceDate`__: A datetime column that records the date and time of each transaction.

    
- __`UnitPrice`__: A float column representing the unit price of each product.

    
- __`CustomerID`__: A float column that contains the customer ID for each transaction. This column has a significant number of missing values, with only 406,829 non-null entries out of 541,909.

    
- __`Country`__: An object column recording the country where each transaction took place.

From a preliminary overview, it seems that there are missing values in the `Description` and `CustomerID` columns which need to be addressed. The `InvoiceDate` column is already in datetime format, which will facilitate further time series analysis. We also observe that a single customer can have multiple transactions as inferred from the repeated `CustomerID` in the initial rows.

The next steps would include deeper data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, potentially erroneous data, and to create new features that can help in achieving the project goals.

- __`Quantity`__:
   - The average quantity of products in a transaction is approximately 9.55.
   - The quantity has a wide range, with a minimum value of -80995 and a maximum value of 80995. The negative values indicate returned or cancelled orders, which need to be handled appropriately.
   - The standard deviation is quite large, indicating a significant spread in the data. The presence of outliers is indicated by a large difference between the maximum and the 75th percentile values.

    
- __`UnitPrice`__:
   - The average unit price of the products is approximately 4.61.
   - The unit price also shows a wide range, from -11062.06 to 38970, which suggests the presence of errors or noise in the data, as negative prices don't make sense.
   - Similar to the Quantity column, the presence of outliers is indicated by a large difference between the maximum and the 75th percentile values.

    
- __`CustomerID`__:
   - There are 406829 non-null entries, indicating missing values in the dataset which need to be addressed.
   - The Customer IDs range from 12346 to 18287, helping in identifying unique customers.

    
- __`InvoiceNo`__:
   - There are 25900 unique invoice numbers, indicating 25900 separate transactions.
   - The most frequent invoice number is 573585, appearing 1114 times, possibly representing a large transaction or an order with multiple items.

    
- __`StockCode`__:
   - There are 4070 unique stock codes representing different products.
   - The most frequent stock code is 85123A, appearing 2313 times in the dataset.

    
- __`Description`__:
   - There are 4223 unique product descriptions.
   - The most frequent product description is "WHITE HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER", appearing 2369 times.
   - There are some missing values in this column which need to be treated.

    
- __`Country`__:
   - The transactions come from 38 different countries, with a dominant majority of the transactions (approximately 91.4%) originating from the United Kingdom.

<h3 align="left"><font color=#ff6200>Handling Missing Values Strategy:</font></h3>

- __`CustomerID` (24.93% missing values)__
   - The `CustomerID` column contains nearly a quarter of missing data. This column is essential for clustering customers and creating a recommendation system. Imputing such a large percentage of missing values might introduce significant bias or noise into the analysis.
    
   - Moreover, since the clustering is based on customer behavior and preferences, it's crucial to have accurate data on customer identifiers. Therefore, removing the rows with missing `CustomerID`s seems to be the most reasonable approach to maintain the integrity of the clusters and the analysis.

    
- __`Description` (0.27% missing values)__
   - The `Description` column has a minor percentage of missing values. However, it has been noticed that there are inconsistencies in the data where the same `StockCode` does not always have the same `Description`. This indicates data quality issues and potential errors in the product descriptions.
    
   - Given these inconsistencies, imputing the missing descriptions based on `StockCode` might not be reliable. Moreover, since the missing percentage is quite low, it would be prudent to remove the rows with missing `Description`s to avoid propagating errors and inconsistencies into the subsequent analyses.
   
By removing rows with missing values in the `CustomerID` and `Description` columns, we aim to construct a cleaner and more reliable dataset, which is essential for achieving accurate clustering and creating an effective recommendation system.

Keeping these duplicate rows can introduce noise and potential inaccuracies in the clustering and recommendation system.

Therefore, I am going to remove these completely identical duplicate rows from the dataset.

- Enhance the clustering process by incorporating patterns and trends observed in cancellation data, which might represent certain customer behaviors or preferences.
    
    
- Allow the recommendation system to possibly prevent suggesting products that have a high likelihood of being cancelled, thereby improving the quality of recommendations.

- __Product Variety__: The dataset contains 3684 unique stock codes, indicating a substantial variety of products available in the online retail store. This diversity can potentially lead to the identification of distinct customer clusters, with preferences for different types of products.

    
- __Popular Items__: A closer look at the top 10 most frequent stock codes can offer insights into the popular products or categories that are frequently purchased by customers.

    
- __Stock Code Anomalies__: We observe that while most stock codes are composed of 5 or 6 characters, there are some anomalies like the code '__POST__'. These anomalies might represent services or non-product transactions (perhaps postage fees) rather than actual products. To maintain the focus of the project, which is clustering based on product purchases and creating a recommendation system, these anomalies should be further investigated and possibly treated appropriately to ensure data integrity.

The output indicates the following:

- A majority of the unique stock codes (3676 out of 3684) contain exactly 5 numeric characters, which seems to be the standard format for representing product codes in this dataset.

    
- There are a few anomalies: 7 stock codes contain no numeric characters and 1 stock code contains only 1 numeric character. These are clearly deviating from the standard format and need further investigation to understand their nature and whether they represent valid product transactions.

Now, let's identify the stock codes that contain 0 or 1 numeric characters to further understand these anomalies:
"""

# Finding and printing the stock codes with 0 and 1 numeric characters
anomalous_stock_codes = [code for code in unique_stock_codes if sum(c.isdigit() for c in str(code)) in (0, 1)]

Based on the analysis, we find that a very small proportion of the records, __0.48%__, have anomalous stock codes, which deviate from the typical format observed in the majority of the data. Also, these anomalous codes are just a fraction among all unique stock codes (__only 8 out of 3684__).

These codes seem to represent non-product transactions like "__BANK CHARGES__", "__POST__" (possibly postage fees), etc. Since they do not represent actual products and are a very small proportion of the dataset, including them in the analysis might introduce noise and distort the clustering and recommendation system.

Given the context of the project, where the aim is to cluster customers based on their product purchasing behaviors and develop a product recommendation system, it would be prudent to exclude these records with anomalous stock codes from the dataset.

RFM is a method used for analyzing customer value and segmenting the customer base. It is an acronym that stands for:

- __Recency (R):__ This metric indicates how recently a customer has made a purchase. A lower recency value means the customer has purchased more recently, indicating higher engagement with the brand.

    
- __Frequency (F):__ This metric signifies how often a customer makes a purchase within a certain period. A higher frequency value indicates a customer who interacts with the business more often, suggesting higher loyalty or satisfaction.

    
- __Monetary (M):__ This metric represents the total amount of money a customer has spent over a certain period. Customers who have a higher monetary value have contributed more to the business, indicating their potential high lifetime value.

    
Together, these metrics help in understanding a customer's buying behavior and preferences, which is pivotal in personalizing marketing strategies and creating a recommendation system.

We've done a great job so far! We have created a dataset that focuses on our customers, using a variety of new features that give us a deeper understanding of their buying patterns and preferences.

Now that our dataset is ready, we can move on to the next steps of our project. This includes looking at our data more closely to find any patterns or trends, making sure our data is in the best shape by checking for and handling any outliers, and preparing our data for the clustering process. All of these steps will help us build a strong foundation for creating our customer segments and, eventually, a personalized recommendation system.

⬆️ [Tabel of Contents](#contents_tabel)

<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">

In this section, I will identify and handle outliers in our dataset. Outliers are data points that are significantly different from the majority of other points in the dataset. These points can potentially skew the results of our analysis, especially in k-means clustering where they can significantly influence the position of the cluster centroids. Therefore, it is essential to identify and treat these outliers appropriately to achieve more accurate and meaningful clustering results.

Given the multi-dimensional nature of the data, it would be prudent to use algorithms that can detect outliers in multi-dimensional spaces. I am going to use the __Isolation Forest__ algorithm for this task. This algorithm works well for multi-dimensional data and is computationally efficient. It isolates observations by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature.

Let's proceed with this approach:
"""

# Initializing the IsolationForest model with a contamination parameter of 0.05
model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.05, random_state=0)

# Fitting the model on our dataset (converting DataFrame to NumPy to avoid warning)
customer_data['Outlier_Scores'] = model.fit_predict(customer_data.iloc[:, 1:].to_numpy())

# Creating a new column to identify outliers (1 for inliers and -1 for outliers)
customer_data['Is_Outlier'] = [1 if x == -1 else 0 for x in customer_data['Outlier_Scores']]

# Display the first few rows of the customer_data dataframe
customer_data.head()

"""<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
    
After applying the Isolation Forest algorithm, we have identified the outliers and marked them in a new column named `Is_Outlier`. We have also calculated the outlier scores which represent the anomaly score of each record.

Now let's visualize the distribution of these scores and the number of inliers and outliers detected by the model:
"""

# Calculate the percentage of inliers and outliers
outlier_percentage = customer_data['Is_Outlier'].value_counts(normalize=True) * 100

# Plotting the percentage of inliers and outliers
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 4))
outlier_percentage.plot(kind='barh', color='#ff6200')

# Adding the percentage labels on the bars

<h3 align="left"><font color=#ff6200>Inference: </font></h3>
    
From the above plot, we can observe that about 5% of the customers have been identified as outliers in our dataset. This percentage seems to be a reasonable proportion, not too high to lose a significant amount of data, and not too low to retain potentially noisy data points. It suggests that our isolation forest algorithm has worked well in identifying a moderate percentage of outliers, which will be critical in refining our customer segmentation.

Considering the nature of the project (customer segmentation using clustering), it is crucial to handle these outliers to prevent them from affecting the clusters' quality significantly. Therefore, I will separate these outliers for further analysis and remove them from our main dataset to prepare it for the clustering analysis.

Let's proceed with the following steps:

- Separate the identified outliers for further analysis and save them as a separate file (optional).
- Remove the outliers from the main dataset to prevent them from influencing the clustering process.
- Drop the `Outlier_Scores` and `Is_Outlier` columns as they were auxiliary columns used for the outlier detection process.

Let's implement these steps:
"""

# Separate the outliers for analysis
outliers_data = customer_data[customer_data['Is_Outlier'] == 1]

# Remove the outliers from the main dataset

Before we proceed to KMeans clustering, it's essential to check the correlation between features in our dataset. The presence of __multicollinearity__, where __features are highly correlated__, can potentially affect the clustering process by not allowing the model to learn the actual underlying patterns in the data, as the features do not provide unique information. This could lead to clusters that are not well-separated and meaningful.

If we identify multicollinearity, we can utilize dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA. These techniques help in neutralizing the effect of multicollinearity by transforming the correlated features into a new set of uncorrelated variables, preserving most of the original data's variance. This step not only enhances the quality of clusters formed but also makes the clustering process more computationally efficient.

Looking at the heatmap, we can see that there are some pairs of variables that have high correlations, for instance:

- `Total_Spend` and `Total_Products_Purchased`

- `Cancellation_Rate` and `Cancellation_Frequency`

Before moving to the next steps, considering the impact of multicollinearity on KMeans clustering, it might be beneficial to treat this multicollinearity possibly through dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA to create a set of uncorrelated variables.

⬆️ [Tabel of Contents](#contents_tabel)

<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">

Before we move forward with the clustering and dimensionality reduction, it's imperative to scale our features. This step holds significant importance, especially in the context of distance-based algorithms like K-means and dimensionality reduction methods like PCA. Here's why:

  - __For K-means Clustering__: K-means relies heavily on the concept of '__distance__' between data points to form clusters. When features are not on a similar scale, features with larger values can disproportionately influence the clustering outcome, potentially leading to incorrect groupings.
  
    
  - __For PCA__: PCA aims to find the directions where the data varies the most. When features are not scaled, those with larger values might dominate these components, not accurately reflecting the underlying patterns in the data.

<h3 align="left"><font color=#ff6200>Methodology: </font></h3>
    
Therefore, to ensure a balanced influence on the model and to reveal the true patterns in the data, I am going to standardize our data, meaning transforming the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. However, not all features require scaling. Here are the exceptions and the reasons why they are excluded:

- __CustomerID__: This feature is just an identifier for the customers and does not contain any meaningful information for clustering.
    
    
- __Is_UK__: This is a binary feature indicating whether the customer is from the UK or not. Since it already takes a value of 0 or 1, scaling it won't make any significant difference.
    
    
- __Day_Of_Week__: This feature represents the most frequent day of the week that the customer made transactions. Since it's a categorical feature represented by integers (1 to 7), scaling it would not be necessary.

    
I will proceed to scale the other features in the dataset to prepare it for PCA and K-means clustering.

<h3 align="left"><font color=#ff6200>Why We Need Dimensionality Reduction? </font></h3>

- __Multicollinearity Detected__: In the previous steps, we identified that our dataset contains multicollinear features. Dimensionality reduction can help us remove redundant information and alleviate the multicollinearity issue.

    
- __Better Clustering with K-means__: Since K-means is a distance-based algorithm, having a large number of features can sometimes dilute the meaningful underlying patterns in the data. By reducing the dimensionality, we can help K-means to find more compact and well-separated clusters.    
   
    
- __Noise Reduction__: By focusing only on the most important features, we can potentially remove noise in the data, leading to more accurate and stable clusters.    
   
    
- __Enhanced Visualization__: In the context of customer segmentation, being able to visualize customer groups in two or three dimensions can provide intuitive insights. Dimensionality reduction techniques can facilitate this by reducing the data to a few principal components which can be plotted easily.
    
    
- __Improved Computational Efficiency__: Reducing the number of features can speed up the computation time during the modeling process, making our clustering algorithm more efficient.


Let's proceed to select an appropriate dimensionality reduction method to our data.

<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<h3 align="left"><font color=#ff6200>Which Dimensionality Reduction Method? </font></h3>
  
    
In this step, we are considering the application of dimensionality reduction techniques to simplify our data while retaining the essential information. Among various methods such as KernelPCA, ICA, ISOMAP, TSNE, and UMAP, I am starting with **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**. Here's why:

PCA is an excellent starting point because it works well in capturing linear relationships in the data, which is particularly relevant given the multicollinearity we identified in our dataset. It allows us to reduce the number of features in our dataset while still retaining a significant amount of the information, thus making our clustering analysis potentially more accurate and interpretable. Moreover, it is computationally efficient, which means it won't significantly increase the processing time.

However, it's essential to note that we are keeping our options open. After applying PCA, if we find that the first few components do not capture a significant amount of variance, indicating a loss of vital information, we might consider exploring other non-linear methods. These methods can potentially provide a more nuanced approach to dimensionality reduction, capturing complex patterns that PCA might miss, albeit at the cost of increased computational time and complexity.

We will apply PCA on all the available components and plot the cumulative variance explained by them. This process will allow me to visualize how much variance each additional principal component can explain, thereby helping me to pinpoint the optimal number of components to retain for the analysis:

The plot and the cumulative explained variance values indicate how much of the total variance in the dataset is captured by each principal component, as well as the cumulative variance explained by the first n components.

Here, we can observe that:

- The first component explains approximately 28% of the variance.

- The first two components together explain about 49% of the variance.

- The first three components explain approximately 61% of the variance, and so on.

    
To choose the optimal number of components, we generally look for a point where adding another component doesn't significantly increase the cumulative explained variance, often referred to as the "__elbow point__" in the curve.

From the plot, we can see that the increase in cumulative variance starts to slow down after the __6th component__ (which __captures about 81% of the total variance__).

Considering the context of customer segmentation, we want to retain a sufficient amount of information to identify distinct customer groups effectively. Therefore, retaining __the first 6 components__ might be a balanced choice, as they together explain a substantial portion of the total variance while reducing the dimensionality of the dataset.

<h2 align="left"><font color=#ff6200>K-Means:</font></h2>

- __K-Means__ is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that clusters data into a specified number of groups (K) by minimizing the __within-cluster sum-of-squares (WCSS)__, also known as __inertia__. The algorithm iteratively assigns each data point to the nearest centroid, then updates the centroids by calculating the mean of all assigned points. The process repeats until convergence or a stopping criterion is reached.

Here are the main drawbacks of the K-means clustering algorithm and their corresponding solutions:

- 1️⃣ __Inertia is influenced by the number of dimensions__: The value of inertia tends to increase in high-dimensional spaces due to the curse of dimensionality, which can distort the Euclidean distances between data points.

> __Solution:__ Performing dimensionality reduction, such as __PCA__, before applying K-means to alleviate this issue and speed up computations.
    
___
    
- 2️⃣ __Dependence on Initial Centroid Placement__: The K-means algorithm might find a local minimum instead of a global minimum, based on where the centroids are initially placed.

> __Solution:__ To enhance the likelihood of locating the global minimum, we can employ the __k-means++ initialization__ method.
  
___
    
- 3️⃣ __Requires specifying the number of clusters__: K-means requires specifying the number of clusters (K) beforehand, which may not be known in advance.

> __Solution:__ Using methods such as the __elbow method__ and __silhouette analysis__ to estimate the optimal number of clusters.
    
___     
    
- 4️⃣ __Sensitivity to unevenly sized or sparse clusters__: K-means might struggle with clusters of different sizes or densities.

> __Solution:__ Increasing the number of random initializations (n_init) or consider using algorithms that handle unevenly sized clusters better, like GMM or DBSCAN.
    
___
    
- 5️⃣ __Assumes convex and isotropic clusters__: K-means assumes that clusters are spherical and have similar variances, which is not always the case. It may struggle with elongated or irregularly shaped clusters.
    
> __Solution:__ Considering using clustering algorithms that do not make these assumptions, such as DBSCAN or Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).

Taking into account the aforementioned considerations, I initially applied PCA to the dataset. For the KMeans algorithm, I will set the `init` parameter to `k-means++` and `n_init` to `10`.

<h3 align="left"><font color=#ff6200>What is the Elbow Method?</font></h3>
    
The Elbow Method is a technique for identifying the ideal number of clusters in a dataset. It involves iterating through the data, generating clusters for various values of k. The k-means algorithm calculates the sum of squared distances between each data point and its assigned cluster centroid, known as the __inertia__ or __WCSS__ score. By plotting the inertia score against the k value, we create a graph that typically exhibits an elbow shape, hence the name "__Elbow Method__". The __elbow point__ represents the k-value where the reduction in inertia achieved by increasing k becomes negligible, indicating the optimal stopping point for the number of clusters.

<h3 align="left"><font color=#ff6200>Optimal k Value: Elbow Method Insights</font></h3>

The optimal value of k for the KMeans clustering algorithm can be found at the __elbow point__. Using the YellowBrick library for the Elbow method, we observe that the suggested optimal k value is __5__. However, __we don't have a very distinct elbow point in this case__, which is common in real-world data. From the plot, we can see that the inertia continues to decrease significantly up to k=5, indicating that __the optimum value of k could be between 3 and 7__. To choose the best k within this range, we can employ the __silhouette analysis__, another cluster quality evaluation method. Additionally, incorporating business insights can help determine a practical k value.

⬆️ [Tabel of Contents](#contents_tabel)

<h3 align="left"><font color=#ff6200>What is the Silhouette Method?</font></h3>
    
The __Silhouette Method__ is an approach to find the optimal number of clusters in a dataset by evaluating the consistency within clusters and their separation from other clusters. It computes the __silhouette coefficient for each data point__, which measures how similar a point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.

____
    
<h3 align="left"><font color=#ff6200>What is the Silhouette Coefficient?</font></h3>
    
To determine the silhouette coefficient for a given point i, follow these steps:

* __Calculate a(i)__: Compute the average distance between point i and all other points within its cluster.
* __Calculate b(i)__: Compute the average distance between point i and all points in the nearest cluster to its own.
* __Compute the silhouette coefficient__, s(i), for point i using the following formula:
    
    $$ s(i) = \frac{b(i) - a(i)}{\max(b(i), a(i))} $$
    
__Note:__ The silhouette coefficient quantifies the similarity of a point to its own cluster (cohesion) relative to its separation from other clusters. This value ranges from -1 to 1, with higher values signifying that the point is well aligned with its cluster and has a low similarity to neighboring clusters.    

____
    
<h3 align="left"><font color=#ff6200>What is the Silhouette Score?</font></h3>
    
The __silhouette score__ is the __average silhouette coefficient__ calculated for all data points in a dataset. It provides an overall assessment of the clustering quality, taking into account both cohesion within clusters and separation between clusters. A higher silhouette score indicates a better clustering configuration.    
    
____
       
<h3 align="left"><font color=#ff6200>What are the Advantages of Silhouette Method over the Elbow Method?</font></h3>
    
* The __Silhouette Method__ evaluates cluster quality by considering __both__ the __cohesion within clusters__ and their __separation__ from other clusters. This provides a more comprehensive measure of clustering performance compared to the __Elbow Method__, which only considers the __inertia__ (sum of squared distances within clusters).


* The __Silhouette Method__ produces a silhouette score that directly quantifies the quality of clustering, making it easier to compare different values of k. In contrast, the __Elbow Method__ relies on the subjective interpretation of the elbow point, which can be less reliable in cases where the plot does not show a clear elbow.

    
* The __Silhouette Method__ generates a visual representation of silhouette coefficients for each data point, allowing for easier identification of fluctuations and outliers within clusters. This helps in determining the optimal number of clusters with higher confidence, as opposed to the __Elbow Method__, which relies on visual inspection of the inertia plot.

In the following analysis:

- I will initially choose a range of 2-6 for the number of clusters (k) based on the Elbow method from the previous section. Next, I will plot __Silhouette scores__ for each k value to determine the one with the highest score.


- Subsequently, to fine-tune the selection of the most appropriate k, I will generate __Silhouette plots__ that visually display the __silhouette coefficients for each data point within various clusters__.


The __YellowBrick__ library will be utilized once again to create these plots and facilitate a comparative analysis.

<h3 align="left"><font color=#ff6200>Guidelines to Interpret Silhouette Plots and Determine the Optimal K:</font></h3>


To interpret silhouette plots and identify the optimal number of clusters (\( k \)), consider the following criteria:

- 1️⃣ __Analyze the Silhouette Plots__:
   
   * __Silhouette Score Width__:
        - __Wide Widths (closer to +1)__: Indicate that the data points in the cluster are well separated from points in other clusters, suggesting well-defined clusters.
        - __Narrow Widths (closer to -1)__: Show that data points in the cluster are not distinctly separated from other clusters, indicating poorly defined clusters.
   
   * __Average Silhouette Score__:
        - __High Average Width__: A cluster with a high average silhouette score indicates well-separated clusters.
        - __Low Average Width__: A cluster with a low average silhouette score indicates poor separation between clusters.

____
    
    
- 2️⃣ __Uniformity in Cluster Size__:
   
   2.1 __Cluster Thickness__:
   - __Uniform Thickness__: Indicates that clusters have a roughly equal number of data points, suggesting a balanced clustering structure.
   - __Variable Thickness__: Signifies an imbalance in the data point distribution across clusters, with some clusters having many data points and others too few.

____
    
    
- 3️⃣ __Peaks in Average Silhouette Score__:
   - __Clear Peaks__: A clear peak in the __average__ silhouette score plot for a specific \( k \) value indicates this \( k \) might be optimal.

____
    
    
- 4️⃣ __Minimize Fluctuations in Silhouette Plot Widths__:
   - __Uniform Widths__: Seek silhouette plots with similar widths across clusters, suggesting a more balanced and optimal clustering.
   - __Variable Widths__: Avoid wide fluctuations in silhouette plot widths, indicating that clusters are not well-defined and may vary in compactness.

____
    
    
- 5️⃣ __Optimal Cluster Selection__:
   - __Maximize the Overall Average Silhouette Score__: Choose the \( k \) value that gives the highest average silhouette score across all clusters, indicating well-defined clusters.
   - __Avoid Below-Average Silhouette Scores__: Ensure most clusters have above-average silhouette scores to prevent suboptimal clustering structures.

____
    
    
- 6️⃣ __Visual Inspection of Silhouette Plots__:
   - __Consistent Cluster Formation__: Visually inspect the silhouette plots for each \( k \) value to evaluate the consistency and structure of the formed clusters.
   - __Cluster Compactness__: Look for more compact clusters, with data points having silhouette scores closer to +1, indicating better clustering.

<h3 align="left"><font color=#ff6200>Optimal k Value: Silhouette Method Insights</font></h3>

Based on above guidelines and after carefully considering the silhouette plots, it's clear that choosing __\( k = 3 \)__ is the better option. This choice gives us clusters that are more evenly matched and well-defined, making our clustering solution stronger and more reliable.

The distribution of customers across the clusters, as depicted by the bar plot, suggests a fairly balanced distribution with clusters 0 and 1 holding around 41% of customers each and cluster 2 accommodating approximately 18% of the customers.

This balanced distribution indicates that our clustering process has been largely successful in identifying meaningful patterns within the data, rather than merely grouping noise or outliers. It implies that each cluster represents a substantial and distinct segment of the customer base, thereby offering valuable insights for future business strategies.

Moreover, the fact that no cluster contains a very small percentage of customers, assures us that each cluster is significant and not just representing outliers or noise in the data.

- The __Silhouette Score__ of approximately 0.236, although not close to 1, still indicates a fair amount of separation between the clusters. It suggests that the clusters are somewhat distinct, but there might be slight overlaps between them. Generally, a score closer to 1 would be ideal, indicating more distinct and well-separated clusters.

    
- The __Calinski Harabasz Score__ is 1257.17, which is considerably high, indicating that the clusters are well-defined. A higher score in this metric generally signals better cluster definitions, thus implying that our clustering has managed to find substantial structure in the data.

    
- The __Davies Bouldin Score__ of 1.37 is a reasonable score, indicating a moderate level of similarity between each cluster and its most similar one. A lower score is generally better as it indicates less similarity between clusters, and thus, our score here suggests a decent separation between the clusters.


In conclusion, the metrics suggest that the clustering is of good quality, with clusters being well-defined and fairly separated. However, there might still be room for further optimization to enhance cluster separation and definition, potentially by trying other clustering and dimensionality reduction algorithms.

Now, focusing on the core 95% of the customer group, I analyze the cleansed customer data to pinpoint the top-selling products within each cluster. Leveraging this information, the system will craft personalized recommendations, suggesting __the top three products__ popular within their cluster that they have not yet purchased. This not only facilitates targeted marketing strategies but also enriches the personal shopping experience, potentially boosting sales. For the outlier group, a basic approach could be to recommend random products, as a starting point to engage them.

# Step 1: Extract the CustomerIDs of the outliers and remove their transactions from the main dataframe
outlier_customer_ids = outliers_data['CustomerID'].astype('float').unique()
df_filtered = df[~df['CustomerID'].isin(outlier_customer_ids)]

# Step 2: Ensure consistent data type for CustomerID across both dataframes before merging
customer_data_cleaned['CustomerID'] = customer_data_cleaned['CustomerID'].astype('float')

# Step 3: Merge the transaction data with the customer data to get the cluster information for each transaction
merged_data = df_filtered.merge(customer_data_cleaned[['CustomerID', 'cluster']], on='CustomerID', how='inner')

# Step 4: Identify the top 10 best-selling products in each cluster based on the total quantity sold
best_selling_products = merged_data.groupby(['cluster', 'StockCode', 'Description'])['Quantity'].sum().reset_index()
best_selling_products = best_selling_products.sort_values(by=['cluster', 'Quantity'], ascending=[True, False])
top_products_per_cluster = best_selling_products.groupby('cluster').head(10)

# Step 5: Create a record of products purchased by each customer in each cluster
customer_purchases = merged_data.groupby(['CustomerID', 'cluster', 'StockCode'])['Quantity'].sum().reset_index()

# Step 6: Generate recommendations for each customer in each cluster
recommendations = []
for cluster in top_products_per_cluster['cluster'].unique():
    top_products = top_products_per_cluster[top_products_per_cluster['cluster'] == cluster]
    customers_in_cluster = customer_data_cleaned[customer_data_cleaned['cluster'] == cluster]['CustomerID']

    for customer in customers_in_cluster:
        # Identify products already purchased by the customer
        customer_purchased_products = customer_purchases[(customer_purchases['CustomerID'] == customer) &

        # Find top 3 products in the best-selling list that the customer hasn't purchased yet
        top_products_not_purchased = top_products[~top_products['StockCode'].isin(customer_purchased_products)]
        top_3_products_not_purchased = top_products_not_purchased.head(3)

        # Append the recommendations to the list
        recommendations.append([customer, cluster] + top_3_products_not_purchased[['StockCode', 'Description']].values.flatten().tolist())

# Step 7: Create a dataframe from the recommendations list and merge it with the original customer data
recommendations_df = pd.DataFrame(recommendations, columns=['CustomerID', 'cluster', 'Rec1_StockCode', 'Rec1_Description', \
                                                 'Rec2_StockCode', 'Rec2_Description', 'Rec3_StockCode', 'Rec3_Description'])
customer_data_with_recommendations = customer_data_cleaned.merge(recommendations_df, on=['CustomerID', 'cluster'], how='right')

# Display 10 random rows from the customer_data_with_recommendations dataframe
customer_data_with_recommendations.set_index('CustomerID').iloc[:, -6:].sample(10, random_state=0)
